# AppliedDataScienceCapstoneProject

• The objective is to evaluate the viability of a commercial space company Space Y that can compete with Space X.<br/>
• Performed Data Collection from SpaceX Rest API and Web Scraping its Wikipedia page and then Data Wrangling.<br/>
• Followed with EDA using matplotlib and seaborn, and also through SQL to analyze the dependencies of features like Payload,
Launch site, Orbit, etc. on the success rate. Built an Interactive map using Folium and a dashboard using Plotly Dash.<br/>
• Performed Predictive Analysis to predict success of a launch by four classification models using sklearn library, executing
GridSearchCV on each model. The decision tree classifier is the best model and has an accuracy of 83% on the test data.
